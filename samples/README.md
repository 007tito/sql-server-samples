## [in-memory] (in-memory/README.md)
In-Memory OLTP can significantly improve OLTP database application performance. It is a memory-optimized database engine integrated into the SQL Server engine, optimized for OLTP. With In-Memory OLTP you can increase the transaction throughput by up to 30 times, depending on the specifics of the workload. The performance gains come from:
  - Tables use memory-optimized data structures and data access methods.
  - Core transaction processing is completely free of locks.
  - Natively compiled modules execute Transact-SQL statements more efficiently.

## [master-data-services] (master-data-services/README.md)
Master Data Services (MDS) is the SQL Server solution for master data management. Master data management (MDM) enables you organization to discover and define non-transactional lists of data, and compile maintainable, reliable master lists.

Master Data Services (MDS) samples are C# console application samples that demonstrate how to customize the way that you and your users interact with Master Data Services.

For information about the new features in SQL Server 2016, see [What's New in Master Data Services (MDS)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff929136.aspx).
For more information about the MDS API, see [Master Data Services Developer Documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh230994.aspx).
