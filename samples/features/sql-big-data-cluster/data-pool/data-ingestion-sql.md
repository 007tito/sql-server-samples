# Data ingestion using SQL stored procedure

SQL Server Big Data clusters provide scale-out compute and storage to improve the performance of analyzing any data. Data from a variety of sources can be ingested and distributed across data pool instances for analysis. In this example, we will insert data from a SQL query into an external table stored in a data pool and query it.

## Instructions

1. Connect to SQL Server Master instance.

1. Execute the .sql script [data-ingestion-sql.sql](data-ingestion-sql.sql).
