# SQL Server Machine Learning Services on master

In this example, we are building a machine learning model using R and a logistic regression algorithm for a recommendation engine on an online store. Based on existing users' click pattern online and their interest in other categories and demographics, we are training a machine learning model. This model will then be used to predict if the visitor is interested in a given item category using the T-SQL PREDICT function.

## Instructions
